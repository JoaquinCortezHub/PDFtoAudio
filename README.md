# PDFtoAudio
A python script to turn PDF files into MP3 files.

## Idea 💡
this idea came from **_Tiff In Tech's_**[Automating My Life With Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXsdt6RMNfY) YouTube video. 
Since the video was released, a few changes were made to one of the packages used in the script, so I had to do some research and modify them.

## Installation & Usage 🛠️
The installation for this project is really simple, you should have these two package installed:
1. pyttsx3 (The package responsible for converting the text into audio).
2. PyPDF2 (The package which extracts the text from the file).

The script doesn't require any more packages or modifications.

## Converting your files 📄
- To convert your files you should place your PDF file in the same directory as your project.
- You can modify the name of the output file in **line 11.**

  > [!Warning]
  > You **MUST** change the name of the file in **line 4** to match the file you want to convert.

- Run the script and enjoy your audio!
